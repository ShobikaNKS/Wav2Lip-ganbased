# Wav2Lip-ganbased
This project generates realistic lip-synced videos by combining speech audio with a static face image using Wav2Lip and Edge TTS. It produces accurate mouth movements, supporting real-time applications like virtual avatars, dubbing, AI assistants, and accessibility solutions for speech-impaired communication.
